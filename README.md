Apple launched SwiftUI which is a UI toolkit and is declarative in nature. I have been working on Storyboard till now but few months back i shifted to SwiftUI and was amazed with the speed at which i was able to knock of my projects.

So i will tell you how i built an iOS application in just few hours using SwiftUI.

First thing first, the UI. I had the design ready with me, my company wanted to build a COVID-19 tracker application, the Android application was already there with the UI and functionalities. the UI had majorly 2 components.
1) HStack
2) VStack
